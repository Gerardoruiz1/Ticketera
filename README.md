# Baseball Stadium Seat Reservation System

## Overview
This project implements a seat reservation system for a baseball stadium. The system manages seat availability, customer reservations, and waitlists for fully booked sections. Operators can perform actions such as reserving seats, canceling reservations, and viewing available sections.

## Features
1. **Seat Reservation**:
   - Allows operators to reserve seats for customers based on availability.
   - Automatically adds customers to a waitlist if a section is fully booked.
   
2. **Cancellation**:

3. **View Availability**:
   - Displays all sections with available seats and those that are fully booked.

4. **Undo Feature**:
   - Supports undoing the last reservation or cancellation action using a stack.

5. **Transaction Logging**:
   - Logs reservation and cancellation transactions in a history list.

6. **Waitlist Management**:
   - Manages a queue for customers waiting for a specific section.

## Technologies Used
The project uses Java and employs the following data structures:
1. **Set**: To store available seats and ensure no duplicate reservations.
